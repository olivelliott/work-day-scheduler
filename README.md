# Work Day Scheduler 
## Goals

### Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Tasks are saved to local storage and persist after refreshing the page. Time blocks are color coded to indicate the status of the task.

## Application

#### Highlights
1. When the planner is opened, the current time and day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. The user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3. When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color coded to indicate the status of past, present, or future. 
4. The user can click on a time block and enter in text.
5. When the user clicks on the save button, that task will be saved to local storage.
6. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
